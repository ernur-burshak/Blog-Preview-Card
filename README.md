### What I learned

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree";
  font-weight: 500, 800;
  src: url("../assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf") format("truetype");
}
```

```css
.container-main-image {
  background-image: url("../assets/images/illustration-article.svg");
}
```

```css
.learning-text {
  width: fit-content;
}
```

- In this task, I also knew how to work with svg images.
